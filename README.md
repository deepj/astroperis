StandardRB is a tool for checking and enforcing Ruby coding standards. It helps developers write consistent, high-quality code and avoid common mistakes. Using StandardRB can save time, improve code quality, and make it easier for others to understand and work with your code. To use it, add it as a dependency in your Gemfile and run the standardrb command in your project's directory. You can also use the --fix option to automatically fix any issues that are found.
